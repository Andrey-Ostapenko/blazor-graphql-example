# blazor-graphql-example
This is an example of using graphql with blazor

---
This example uses [graphql-client](https://github.com/graphql-dotnet/graphql-client) as gateway between GraphQl schema and C# classes.
GraphQl schema is created, using [postgraphile](https://github.com/graphile/postgraphile).
> Note: Blazor is an *experimental* project. It's not (yet) a committed product. This is to allow time to fully investigate the technical issues associated with running .NET in the browser.
